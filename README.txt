#Nashville Public Art

This app displays public art pieces on a google map with an info window that shows information about that art piece. 

To get started:
1- clone/fork repo
2- cd into/dir
3- npm install
4- node server.js
5- view localhost:8080 in your browser

grunt watch will watch *.js files and will run jshint, uglify, concat, and cssmin unpon changes to files. 

Feel free to fork and make whatever improvements you would like. Submit a pull request, and I will review it.
